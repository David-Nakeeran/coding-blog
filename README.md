## Reflection

Unfortunately I didn't have time this weekend to work on the project. So I only achieved one stretch goal.

Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

- Creating a post, CRUD on comments.

What was difficult about the tasks you didn't complete?

- Just understanding how NextJs works in general. I believe the way I have structured the usage of server functions into an action.js file is correct?

## Technologies Used

- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)

- Styling: Tailwind CSS

- Database: PostgreSQL

- Database Access: pg (node-postgres)
